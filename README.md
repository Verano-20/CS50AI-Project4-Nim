My solution for CS50AI Project 4 - Nim.

Nim: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#:~:text=Nim%20is%20a%20mathematical%20game,the%20same%20heap%20or%20pile.

By having an AI play the game agaist itself many times, it is able to use Q-Learning to determine Q-Values for different states of the game, and then choose which action to take based on these learned values. Over time, the values become more accurate and the AI is able to play better.
